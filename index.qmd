# 👋 Hello, I’m Stanberley

I am a student at **Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT)**, currently taking  
**Bachelor of Science with Honours in Applied Computing with a specialisation in Fintech**.

I am particularly interested in how blockchain can improve **transparency, security, and efficiency**
in areas such as digital payments, decentralised finance (DeFi), and financial data management.
