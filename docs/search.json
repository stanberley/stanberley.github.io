    "text": "🤖 GenAI tool that I have used:\nI have used ChatGPT as my GenAI tool. ChatGPT assisted me by providing simpler explanations and examples on technical concept related to programming, web development and mathematics. It was particularly useful especially when ChatGPT is able to adjust to my ability to absorb knowledge and provide explanations that are easier to understand. It also helped me debug errors, and improve the clarity of my codes.\n\n\n⚙️ How GenAI tools can assist me for my future study/work\nGenAI tools such as ChatGPT can be valuable in supporting my current studies: - Clarify complex technical concepts related to programming, blockchain and mathematics - Assist in problem-solving by suggesting possible approaches or debugging steps - - Allow customised instructions so that the GenAI tool is not a “yes-only” system, but can actively challenge assumptions, point out mistakes, and provide corrective feedback when needed. This encourages critical thinking rather than passive acceptance of generated responses.\n(images/genAI.png){width=200}"
